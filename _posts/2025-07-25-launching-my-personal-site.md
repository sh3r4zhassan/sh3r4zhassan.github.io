I’ve officially launched my new academic website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages! It’s clean, multi-page, and easier to update than ever.

This blog will include updates on my research, new projects, and general thoughts on building wearable systems and embedded machine learning for health.

Thanks for stopping by!
