      I’m a CS PhD student at the School of Interactive Computing, <strong>Georgia Institute of Technology</strong>, with a background in Electrical Engineering from <strong>Lahore University of Management Sciences</strong>. My research interests sit at the intersection of machine learning, embedded systems, and wearable sensing, with a focus on healthcare applications. I design low-power, resource-constrained systems with multimodal sensing and deploy optimized on-device machine learning models (TinyML) for physiological monitoring. Spanning both system design and algorithm deployment, my goal is to enable scalable, cost-effective solutions for continuous sensing and decision making in real world environments.

      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2em; text-align: justify;">
        Beyond research and teaching, I actively contribute to the academic community as a peer reviewer. I served as a reviewer for <strong>CHI 2024</strong> (ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems), participating in both initial and revise-and-resubmit rounds. I also reviewed papers for the <strong>IEEE Body Sensor Networks (BSN) 2024</strong> conference, offering detailed feedback on emerging work in biomedical systems and haptics. I am committed to supporting rigorous, constructive peer review for research in interactive systems, health sensing, and wearable technologies.
